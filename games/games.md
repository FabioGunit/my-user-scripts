## Steam Own Game Bundle Checker


This script get all your Steam library information (games that you own) and compare it with pages that sell games bundles.

> **Note:** please double check games marked as "not own", if the games name is misspelled could be confuse the algorithm. I will continue working to make more exact the game search. 

### Configuration
